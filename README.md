The concept of digital watermarking has been known for 30 years, mainly for image and audio contents. The goal is to insert a unique, hidden and non-removable signal in the original content, to be used as an identifier. If a thief steals a content, the original owner can still prove his/her ownership. ML Model Watermarking offers basic primitives for researchers and machine learning enthusiasts to watermark their models, without advanced knowledge of underlying concepts.

* :book: Watermark models on various tasks, such as **image classification** or **sentiment analysis**, with a compatibility with the main Machine Learning frameworks like [Scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn), [Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) or the [HuggingFace library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).
* :triangular_flag_on_post: Detect if one of your models has been used without consent.
* :chart_with_upwards_trend: Integrate watermark in your pipeline, with a negligible accuracy loss.

## Installation


Simply run:

``` python
>>>  pip install .
```

## How to use it

ML Model Watermarking acts as a wrapper for your model, provoding a range of techniques for watermarking your model as well as ownership detection function. After the watermarking phase, you can retrieve your model and save the ownership information. 

``` python
>>> from mlmodelwatermarking.markface import TrainerWM

>>> trainer = TrainerWM(model=your_model)
>>> ownership = trainer.watermark()
>>> watermarked_model = trainer.get_model()
```

Later, it is possible verify if a given model has been stolen based on the ownership information

``` python
>>> from mlmodelwatermarking.marktorch import TrainerWM
>>> from mlmodelwatermarking.verification import verify

>>> trainer = TrainerWM(model=suspect_model, ownership=ownership)
>>> trainer.verify()
{'is_stolen': True, 'score': 0.88, 'threshold': 0.66}
```
